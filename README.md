# Wisetip

Useful tips around the internet are buried under a lot of noise (intros, stretched content ...), this is mainly due to policies and recommendation algorithms of content platforms.
We value your time, memory and attention, all the tips you need are in one place straight to the point.

## About us

we are two guys trying to bootstrap useful digital tools,
we want to make these tools protect human weaknesses instead of exploiting them,
we want this tools to solve one problem and one problem only at a time,
less is more, with the age of generative AI less content is more, we aim to provide little but high quality content,
we want to reverse engineer platforms such as youtube, facebook, instagram ... and make alternatives that increase the quality of life for people, protect their attention, social life, spending habits ... and so on.

we make profit from donations and one-time payments.
